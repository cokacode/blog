# CSES Problem - Two Sets

## Problem
The problem is - https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1092 

We need to find if the given `n`, we have to check whether it is possible to bi-furcate the set {x| 1<=x<=n; n <= 10^6} as such that the sum of both the resultent sets will be equal.

## Solution

### Explanation 
This is another problem that will make use of arthematic progression, so we need to figure out if the sum of set `{1 ... n}` can be divided by two completely, if yes, than we can break the set into two peices, consisting of same sum.

## Code

```javascript
console.log("yet to write");
```
